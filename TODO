As the development has switched focus on to producing a playable prototype, we will need to implement certain components:

  Multiplayer Networking
  AI Ally/Enemy
  
Once these implementations are completed, we can shift our focus back to creating the editors.

The first step in implementing the multiplayer component would be to find a way to host a server on Unity.
The first step in implementing AI's would be to find and research certain AI's behavior patterns.
